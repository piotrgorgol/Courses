How does your visualization leverage at least one “pop-out effect” or “pre-attentive attribute?”
Which one(s) was (were) chosen and why?
I’ve simply used red color to make three the worst departments stand out. Red color means that
something is bad/wrong with those marked numbers. In this case they have lowest sales.


How does your visualization utilize at least one Gestalt principle? Which principle(s) is (are) being
reflected, and how?
Similarity is that one Gestalt principle my visualization actually performs. Viz shows all elements as
circles and only color make some of the stand out.


How does your design reflect an understanding of cognitive load and clutter?
I’ve removed almost all of headers, used only two colors.


Is your visualization static or interactive? Why did you choose that format?
My viz is interactive. By that I mean you can change the region of sales. You could observe how sales
change in different regions. In this case in all regions the lowest sales departments are the same.


What need does this visualization address that words or numbers alone cannot fill?
I think it’s just simple to look at it and realize what’s going on. You just need one second to see what
categories have the smallest sales.
