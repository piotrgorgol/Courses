Question 1
Consider the given NumPy arrays a and b. What will be the value of c after the following code is executed?
46


2.
Question 2
Given the string s as shown below, which of the following expressions will be True?
bool(re.match('A', s)) == True


3.
Question 3
Consider a string s. We want to find all characters (other than A) which are followed by triple A, i.e., have AAA to the right. We donâ€™t want to include the triple A in the output and just want the character immediately preceding AAA . Complete the code given below that would output the required result.
def result():
    s = 'ACAABAACAAABACDBADDDFSDDDFFSSSASDAFAAACBAAAFASD'

    result = []
    pattern = 'A{3}(.*)\b(?<!AAA)'
    for item in re.finditer(pattern, s):
      result.append(item.group())
      
    return result

Question 4

Consider the following 4 expressions regarding the above pandas Series df. All of them have the same value except one expression. Can you identify which one it is?
df.index[0]




5.
Question 5

Consider the two pandas Series objects shown above, representing the no. of items of different yogurt flavors that were sold in a day from two different stores, s1 and s2. Which of the following statements is True regarding the Series s3 defined below?
s3['Mango'] >=  s1.add(s2, fill_value = 0)['Mango']




6.
Question 6
In the following list of statements regarding a DataFrame df, one or more statements are correct. Can you identify all the correct statements?
Every time we call df.set_index(), the old index will be discarded.
Every time we call df.reset_index(), the old index will be set as a new column.

Question 7
Consider the Series object S defined below. Which of the following is an incorrect way to slice S such that we obtain all data points corresponding to the indices 'b', 'c', and 'd'?
S['b':'e']



8.
Question 8

Consider the DataFrame df shown above with indexes 'R1', 'R2', 'R3', and 'R4'. In the following code, a new DataFrame df_new is created using df. What will be the value of df_new[1] after the below code is executed?
88
